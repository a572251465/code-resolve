# Learning Resources

The Redux docs are intended to teach the basic concepts of Redux, as well as explain key concepts for use in real-world applications. However, the docs can't cover everything. Happily, there are many other great resources available for learning Redux. We encourage you to check them out. Many of them cover topics that are beyond the scope of the docs, or describe the same topics in other ways that may work better for your learning style.

This page includes our recommendations for some of the best external resources available to learn Redux. For an additional extensive list of tutorials, articles, and other resources on React, Redux, Javascript, and related topics, see the [React/Redux Links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links).

## Courses

- **Modern React with Redux, by Stephen Grider (paid)** <br/>
  https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/ <br/>
  Master the fundamentals of React and Redux with this tutorial as you develop apps with React Router, Webpack, and ES6. This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build React components and structure applications with Redux.

- **Redux, by Tyler McGinnis (paid)** <br/>
  https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/redux/ <br/>
  When learning Redux, you need to learn it in the context of an app big enough to see the benefits. That's why this course is huge. A better name might be _"Real World Redux"_. If you're sick of "todo list" Redux tutorials, you've come to the right place. In this course we'll talk all about what makes Redux special for managing state in your application. We'll build an actual "real world" application so you can see how Redux handles edge cases like optimistic updates and error handling. We'll also cover many other technologies that work well with Redux, Firebase, and CSS Modules.

- **Learn Redux, by Wes Bos (free)** <br/>
  https://learnredux.com/ <br/>
  A video course that walks through building 'Reduxstagram' — a simple photo app that will simplify the core ideas behind Redux, React Router and React.js
